# ESP32-Open-Source-Watch
THe repository for code and deisng files for my ESP32-Cam open source smart watch

I bought a DZ09 smart watch- throughoughly disappointed.
I wanted a WearOS watch, price tag, scary.

So, why not make a best of both worlds smart watch?
A pricetag under $50, with all teh same capabilities, if not more?

Planned:
A watch based off the ESP32-Cam board, with the regular capabilities of a phone!
-1.5" TFT Tocuhscreen
-USB charger (unsure about ttl converter a the moment. May be possible later? For now USB for charging only, sorry, unless someone wants to add it to the design files, cheaply?)
-Bluetooth, Wifi, GSM
-500mAh LiPo battery (current testign is with a 400mAh... sorry)
-auto screen brightness? I fi can figure out the tft module...

I dunno, fork it, add pull requests, check out the kickstarter I will make soon I swear
Chassis will be printed from PLA, unsuire about the wrist bands?

I am makign this all up at 6:09 AM PST after ebign awake since, 2PM, yesterday? I don't know I work nights
